# Ultrasensitive-Silent-Speech
The repo for paper "Ultrasensitive Textile Strain Sensors Redefine Wearable Silent Speech Interfaces with High Machine Learning Efficiency". See more details of the datasets and background information in the paper.

The Repo includes the following datasets:

1.Dataset1_20 Frequently Used Words: This dataset contains signals of the 20 most frequently used words (10 nouns and 10 verbs) collected from participants, with 100 samples per class. Each sample of a word is represented in a row, with the last number in each row indicating the class label for that word (the same applies to the following datasets).

2.Dataset2_Confusing Words: This dataset includes 5 pairs of 10 words with similar pronunciations that are easily confused, with 100 samples per class.

3.Dataset3_Different Reading Speeds: This dataset comprises signals of 5 long words read at three different speeds: fast, medium, and slow, with approximately 33 samples for each word at each reading speed. The distribution of reading durations for these words can be found in Supplementary Figure 12.

4.New User Generalization Test: This dataset contains signals of 5 commonly used words (included in Dataset1) collected from three new users, with 50 samples per class.

5.Noise Injection Data: This dataset includes around five minutes of silent noise signals (containing physiological noises such as breathing and swallowing) recorded in the absence of speech.
